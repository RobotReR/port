            Through psychiatrist and roommate Aluízio Porto Carrero, he would befriend Ivan Lins, as well as his first wife, Ângela, with whom he had two children, Daniel and Fernanda. He would later have another child, Amora Pêra, with actress Sandra Pêra. While living with Porto Carrer, he founded Movimento Artístico Universitário (MAU), with Aldir Blanc, Ivan Lins, Márcio Proença, Paulo Emílio, and César Costa Filho. This movement played an important role in música popular brasileira in the '70s and in 1971 resulted in the program Som Livre Exportação on TV Globo.

Characterized by a critical stance towards the dictatorship, Gonzaguinha was targeted by the Department of Political and Social Order (DOPS). Out of 72 songs reviewed by the DOPS, 54 were censored, including his first hit, Comportamento Geral. In this early part of his career, he was seen as aggressive in the eyes of the media, with songs like "Piada Infeliz" and "Erva," earning the nickname "cantor rancor" [grudge singer].

With the beginning of redemocratization in Brazilian politics in the latter half of the '70s, Gonzaguinha started to compose more lighthearted songs like "Recado," 'Começaria Tudo Outra Vez," "Explode Coração," "Espere por Mim Morena," "Grito de Alerta," "Sangrando, Eu Apenas Queria que Você Soubesse," "Caminhos do Coração," "O Que É o que É, Feliz," "Mamão com Mel e Lindo Lago do Amor," "Nem o Pobre nem o Rei."
